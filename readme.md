For Engine:
Need to implement batching for the meshes,
right now there is only one thing (quad), but if I add more (like circle, etc) I should draw them on after the other
like first all the squares, then all the circles, etc 
so I don't have to switch as often, which saves performance.
Also, need to implement z-layering, so it still gets drawn in the coorect order I want

Same for the textures, once I finnish tem
